# Athlete Intake Profile (Gym + Bike)

Last updated: 2026-02-27

## Athlete Snapshot
- Sex: Male
- Age: 24
- Height: 180 cm
- Current body weight: 70 kg
- Recent bodyweight history: intentional gain from 63 kg to 70 kg in ~2.5 months
- Scale-estimated body fat: ~17% (previously ~11-12% on same scale)

## Current Phase
- Phase: light cut (performance-first)
- Planned length: 6-10 weeks
- Primary protection target: climbing performance
- Secondary target: maintain/improve hypertrophy signal, especially upper body

## Goals by Sport

### Bodybuilding Goal
- Keep/build muscle while cutting slowly
- Emphasis: upper body priority with lower-body training maintained pain-free
- Training level: early intermediate (1-3 years structured lifting)

### Cycling Goal
- Main KPI: improve climbing performance on Farellones route (Santiago, Chile)
- Target style: progress as fast as safely possible
- No fixed date or fixed target time; benchmark periodically
- Preferred interval style: sustained threshold/SST climbing work

## Current Benchmark Data (Farellones Reference)
- Time: 2:22:36
- Average speed: 9.4 km/h
- Average power: 165 W
- Average cadence: 71 rpm
- Elevation gain: 887 m
- Distance: 22.23 km
- Average gradient: 4%

## Physiology and Performance Metrics

### Available now
- Power: available
- Heart rate: available
- Cadence: available
- Resting HR: tracked
- Max HR: tracked
- VO2max estimate: WHOOP estimate 54

### Pending / Missing
- Current FTP: pending (no recent FTP test)
- Threshold HR (LTHR): pending
- Power-duration curve anchors (5 min / 20 min etc.): incomplete

## Training Context
- Preferred weekly pattern: recovery-driven flexible scheduling
- Fixed session: Sunday social ride (mandatory)
- Usual weekday training capacity: 60-90 min most days
- Bike setup: outdoor only
- Smart trainer: no

## Constraints and Injury Notes
- No painful squat pattern currently tolerated
- Known issue: inner-thigh/adductor pain can appear with painful squat patterns
- Other major medical/orthopedic constraints: none reported

## Recovery Model
- Main signal: WHOOP recovery/sleep trends
- Secondary signal: subjective readiness
- Decision model: combine objective + subjective to adjust daily load

## Nutrition Phase Inputs (Current)
- Reported this week intake: 3100 kcal/day
- Tracking quality: strict weighed logging
- Weigh-in quality: daily morning, 7-day average
- Recent trend at 3100 kcal/day: around 0 kg/week (near maintenance)
- Load context: about normal week
- Carb/sodium consistency: mostly consistent
- Sleep disruption: moderate

## Active Cut Setup (Decision-Locked)
- Starting target calories: 2950 kcal/day average
- Adjustment interval: every 2 weeks
- Adjustment step: 100 kcal/day
- Adjustment logic:
  - If 7-day average loss <0.15 kg/week for 2 weeks and performance is stable: reduce by 100 kcal/day
  - If loss >0.35 kg/week or key bike performance drops: increase by 100 kcal/day
- Carb distribution rule: protect carbs on key bike days (climb intervals + Sunday ride)

## Data Quality Notes
- Body-fat percentage is from consumer scale and treated as directional only.
- Primary progress signal is trend weight + training performance, not single-day composition readings.
- Benchmark comparability requires similar route/weather/pacing conditions.

## Retest and Benchmark Cadence
- Formal benchmark frequency: every 4 weeks
- Preferred benchmark: Farellones route when conditions are comparable
- Backup benchmark: standardized 20-min climb test

## Retest Log Template
| Date | Test Type | Result | Conditions | Interpretation | Program Change |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| YYYY-MM-DD | Farellones / 20-min climb / FTP estimate |  | Weather, route, sleep, fueling |  |  |

## Next Data to Collect
- FTP estimate from a standardized outdoor test
- Threshold HR from same benchmark/testing block
- Repeatable power-duration anchors for better zone precision
