# Minimal Hybrid Plan (Gym + Bike)

## Goal
- Keep building muscle with shorter gym sessions
- Progress cycling slowly as a beginner
- Respect no-squat pain and shoulder-friendly pressing
- Keep recovery high so work performance stays good

## Weekly Structure
- Gym: 3 mandatory sessions + 1 optional light session, each 60-90 min (max 1.5h)
- Bike: 3 sessions (including Sunday social ride)
- Practical split with your Sunday ride: usually 50-60% gym, 40-50% bike
- Hard day cap: max 3 hard days/week total (gym + bike combined)

## Daily Morning Routine (10-15 min)
- Purpose: wake up, loosen hips/back/shoulders, and improve posture/breathing for the day
- Keep intensity easy (RPE 2-3/10), no fatigue, no sweating goal
- Do every morning, including rest days

1. 6-7 min mobility flow
- Cat-cow: 8-10 reps
- World’s greatest stretch: 4-5 reps/side
- Deep bodyweight squat hold (or pain-free partial hold): 30-45 sec
- Thoracic rotations: 8 reps/side

2. 4-5 min activation
- Glute bridge: 2x10-12
- Scap push-up or band pull-apart: 2x10-15
- Standing calf raises: 1-2x15-20

3. 2-3 min reset
- Nasal breathing only, slow inhale/exhale (4-6 sec each)
- Optional: short sunlight walk outside

### Sunday - Social Peloton Ride (2-3h)
- Ride by feel with the group
- Try to keep most time in Zone 2, short Zone 3 pulls are fine
- Fuel during ride (see nutrition section)

## Gym Rules (Minimal but Effective)
- No painful squat pattern. Replace immediately if inner thigh pain appears.
- Use mostly machines and stable movements for joint comfort.
- Keep 1-2 RIR on compounds; 0-1 RIR on last isolation set.
- Rest times: 2-3 min compounds, 60-90 sec isolations.
- If short on time, cut the final isolation exercise first.
- For hard compounds, default rep range is 6-10.
- Core is mandatory on Monday + Thursday (short finishers only).
- Core work is hypertrophy style: loaded sets, not long-duration holds.

## Progression
- Double progression:
  - Stay in the listed rep range
  - Add reps week to week
  - When all sets hit top of range, add 2.5-5% load
- Core progression:
  - Add reps within range, then add load (do not increase time-based holds)
- Cycling progression:
  - Keep only Friday as moderate intensity
  - Add 5-10 min to Wednesday Z2 every 1-2 weeks if recovery is good

## Deload (Every 4th Week)
- Gym: cut sets by 40-50%
- Bike: cut volume by 30-40% and remove Friday Zone 3 blocks
- Core: keep same exercises but do only 1-2 easy sets each

## Recovery Guardrails (Priority)
- Max 3 hard days/week total.
- If sleep is poor for 2 nights in a row, reduce next session volume by ~30%.
- If legs feel heavy/stale, switch Friday to Zone 2 only.
- If performance drops for 2 gym sessions in a row, run an immediate easy week:
  - Gym sets -40%
  - Bike volume -30%
  - No Zone 3 work

## Nutrition Notes
- Keep lean gain surplus small: +150 to +250 kcal/day on average
- Protein: 1.8-2.2 g/kg/day
- For rides 90+ min: 30-60 g carbs/hour
- For Sunday 2-3h ride: 45-75 g carbs/hour + electrolytes

## Tracking
- Daily morning weight (use weekly average)
- Waist once weekly
- Gym logbook: reps/load/RIR
- Bike log: duration/HR/RPE

If fatigue rises, first reduce Friday bike intensity, then skip Saturday optional gym.
