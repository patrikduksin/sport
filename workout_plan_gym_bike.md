# Hybrid Performance Cut Plan (Gym + Bike)

Program-only file: this document contains training execution only.
Personal metrics, goals, and intake history are stored in `athlete_intake_profile.md`.

## Current Block Goal (6-10 weeks)
- Run a light cut while protecting climbing performance and muscle.
- Improve climbing performance for the Farellones benchmark.
- Keep lower-body training pain-free (no painful squat pattern).
- Maintain high training quality with recovery-based day shifting.

## Weekly Architecture
- Mandatory sessions per week:
  - 3 gym sessions: `Upper A`, `Lower A`, `Upper B`
  - 2 structured bike sessions: `Bike Endurance Z2`, `Bike Climb Intervals`
  - 1 fixed Sunday `Social Ride`
- Optional session:
  - 1 light pump/recovery gym session (only if fresh)
- Hard-day cap: max 3 hard days/week total.

## Readiness Gate (Before Every Session)
Use both WHOOP and subjective check-in.

- Green readiness:
  - WHOOP green or normal HRV/sleep trend
  - Subjective readiness >=7/10
  - Action: complete full planned session.
- Yellow readiness:
  - WHOOP yellow, sleep disruption, or readiness 5-6/10
  - Action: reduce session volume by 20-30% (drop 1 interval or 1-2 accessory sets).
- Red readiness:
  - WHOOP red or two poor nights in a row, readiness <=4/10
  - Action: replace hard session with 45-60 min easy Z2 or rest/mobility.

## Dynamic Session Sequencing (Sunday Fixed)
Sunday social ride is fixed. Everything else can move.

Rules:
- Keep at least 24 h between `Lower A` and `Bike Climb Intervals` (48 h preferred).
- Do not stack two hard lower-body stress days back to back.
- If you miss a session, drop optional work first, not key sessions.
- Priority order for keeping quality:
  1. Bike Climb Intervals
  2. Sunday Social Ride
  3. Upper A
  4. Upper B
  5. Lower A
  6. Bike Endurance Z2
  7. Optional Light Pump

Practical weekly examples:

Normal recovery week:
- Mon: Upper A
- Tue: Bike Climb Intervals
- Wed: Lower A
- Thu: Upper B
- Fri: Bike Endurance Z2
- Sat: Optional Light Pump or Rest
- Sun: Social Ride

Poor-recovery week:
- Mon: Upper A
- Tue: Bike Endurance Z2 (short)
- Wed: Lower A (reduced volume)
- Thu: Rest
- Fri: Bike Climb Intervals (reduced)
- Sat: Upper B
- Sun: Social Ride

### Bike Endurance Z2 (75-120 min, outdoor)
Purpose: aerobic base, fatigue resistance, pedal economy.

Warm-up (15 min):
- 10 min easy spin building to low Z2
- 3x30 sec high cadence (100-110 rpm), 90 sec easy between

Main set:
- 60-90 min steady Z2
- Power target after FTP is set: 56-75% FTP
- Before FTP is set: RPE 4-5/10 + full-sentence talk test + controlled breathing
- Cadence target:
  - Flat/rolling: 85-95 rpm
  - Climbs: 75-85 rpm without grinding

Cooldown (10-15 min):
- Easy spin and nasal breathing if possible

Outdoor execution rules:
- Favor uninterrupted roads.
- Keep pressure constant instead of chasing speed.
- If traffic interrupts >2 min repeatedly, extend ride time by 10-15 min to recover Z2 time.

### Bike Climb Intervals (Primary Performance Session, 60-100 min)
Purpose: improve sustained climbing power for Farellones-like efforts.

#### Baseline protocol (use first if FTP is not current)
Use this session in week 1 (or anytime FTP is older than 6 weeks).

Warm-up (20 min):
- 10 min easy
- 3x1 min progressive efforts (RPE 7/10), 2 min easy between
- 4-5 min easy before test

Test:
- 20 min best steady effort on a safe, uninterrupted climb/road
- Pacing rule: first 3 min controlled, then hold highest sustainable output
- Record: average power, average HR, cadence, route/weather

Calculations:
- Estimated FTP = 95% of 20-min average power
- Provisional threshold HR = average HR from final 15 min

#### Working interval session (after FTP anchor exists)
Warm-up (20 min):
- 10 min easy to Z2
- 3x1 min at 90-95% FTP, 2 min easy between
- 5 min easy

Main set progression (4-week cycle):
- Week 1: 3x8 min @ 88-92% FTP, 4 min easy between
- Week 2: 3x10 min @ 88-93% FTP, 5 min easy between
- Week 3: 2x15 min @ 90-95% FTP, 6 min easy between
- Week 4: deload/benchmark week (see Deload section)

Cadence:
- Climbs: 75-85 rpm
- Flatter sections: 85-95 rpm

Execution quality targets:
- Keep interval power within roughly +/-5%.
- Avoid early spikes in first 2 min.
- If RPE is >8/10 before halfway through interval 1, reduce target by 2-3% or cut one rep.

Cooldown (10-15 min):
- Easy spin until HR settles

Outdoor execution notes:
- Choose terrain that allows uninterrupted intervals.
- If a stop interrupts an interval for >30 sec, repeat that interval.
- In wind/grade shifts, hold power range and smooth breathing instead of speed.

### Sunday Social Ride (2-3+ h, fixed)
Purpose: endurance durability + climbing economy under group dynamics.

Execution:
- Keep first 60-90 min mostly Z2.
- Short pulls into Z3 are fine.
- Avoid repeated deep surges unless it is a benchmark week.
- If group pace is too hard early, back off and finish with controlled Z2.

Fueling:
- 45-75 g carbs/hour
- Fluids + electrolytes based on weather/sweat

## Progression Rules

### Gym progression
- Double progression on compounds and accessories:
  - Add reps within target range first
  - Add load (2.5-5%) when all sets hit top of range
- Compounds: keep 1-2 RIR
- Isolation: last set can go 0-1 RIR

### Bike progression
- Progress interval time-in-zone first, then intensity.
- If you fail interval quality for 2 sessions in a row, repeat previous successful week instead of adding load.
- Add 10-15 min to Z2 ride only when recovery remains stable.

## Deload and Benchmark (Every 4th Week)
- Gym:
  - Cut sets by 40-50%
  - Keep movement patterns, avoid failure
- Bike:
  - Cut total volume by 30-40%
  - Keep one short quality touch (for example 2x8 min @ 88-90% FTP)
- Benchmark cadence:
  - Every 4 weeks, run one formal benchmark:
    - Preferred: comparable Farellones attempt, or
    - Standardized 20-min climb test if logistics/weather are poor

## Cut-Phase Performance Guardrails
- Keep key quality sessions (Bike Climb Intervals + Sunday ride).
- Reduce accessory gym volume before reducing key intensity.
- If fatigue rises, cut optional session first.
- If needed, shorten Z2 duration before removing climb intervals.

## Nutrition Execution (Current Cut Phase)
- Starting intake target: 2950 kcal/day average.
- Review every 2 weeks using 7-day average bodyweight + performance trend.
- Adjustment rule:
  - If weight loss is <0.15 kg/week for 2 weeks and performance is stable: -100 kcal/day
  - If weight loss is >0.35 kg/week or key performance drops: +100 kcal/day
- Carb protection rule:
  - Keep higher carbs on Bike Climb Intervals and Sunday ride days
  - Pull calories mostly from easier/recovery days

## Tracking Checklist
- Daily morning bodyweight (use 7-day average)
- WHOOP recovery + sleep trend
- Session RPE + readiness score
- Gym logbook: load, reps, RIR
- Bike log:
  - For endurance: duration, avg power/HR, drift notes
  - For intervals: target vs actual power, cadence, interval completion
  - For benchmark: time, avg power, HR, cadence, route/weather

## Safety and Pain Rules
- No painful squat pattern.
- If inner-thigh/adductor pain appears during lower-body work, stop and substitute immediately.
- If pain persists >48 h or worsens week to week, reduce lower-body loading and seek clinical assessment.
