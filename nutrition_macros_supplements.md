# Evidence-Based Macros + Supplement Split (Gym + Bike)

## Your Profile
- Male, 24 y, 180 cm, 70 kg
- Training load from `workout_plan_gym_bike.md`: 3 gym + 3 bike (+ optional light gym)
- You reported: around +0.2 kg/week at 3300 kcal/day when not cycling
- Goal: support hypertrophy while keeping cycling performance high

## Evidence Summary (what this plan is based on)
- For most lifters, hypertrophy benefits tend to plateau around ~1.6 g/kg/day total protein intake, with practical ranges commonly around 1.4-2.0 g/kg/day.
- In calorie deficits, higher protein is useful for lean-mass retention (roughly 2.3-3.1 g/kg FFM in lean trained athletes; practical bodyweight-based use is often ~2.2+ g/kg/day).
- Calorie equations can miss individual needs by hundreds of kcal/day in athletes, so bodyweight trend is more reliable than formula-only estimates.
- Caffeine is consistently ergogenic; most evidence supports 3-6 mg/kg, and newer cycling data suggest <=3 mg/kg can still work well for many.
- Dietary nitrate (beetroot) can help some performance outcomes, with stronger effects from >=6 mmol nitrate and often when taken >=150 min pre-session or loaded for several days.
- Beta-alanine helps most for high-intensity efforts (roughly 1-10 min efforts), less relevant for long easy Z2 work.
- Creatine is strongly supported for strength/lean-mass gains with resistance training.

## Calorie Targets
These are anchored to your real-world data first, then adjusted for your current bike volume.

1) No-cycling anchor from your data:
- You gain ~0.2 kg/week at 3300 kcal/day.
- Practical surplus for that gain rate is usually around +150 to +300 kcal/day.
- So no-cycling maintenance is likely around 3000-3150 kcal/day (center ~3100).

2) Add cycling cost from your current plan:
- Wed 75-90 min Z2: ~700-840 kcal
- Fri 60 min tempo/skills: ~560-700 kcal
- Sun 2-3 h social ride: ~980-1680 kcal
- Weekly bike total: ~2240-3220 kcal/week = ~320-460 kcal/day average

3) Current best starting targets with cycling:
- Estimated maintenance: ~3500 kcal/day (realistic range ~3400-3600)
- Lean bulk: ~3700 kcal/day (+200)
- Light cut: ~3200 kcal/day (-300)

## Macro Split (daily)

### With Cycling (your current plan)
| Phase | Calories | Protein | Fat | Carbs |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Maintain | 3500 kcal | 150 g | 85 g | 534 g |
| Lean bulk | 3700 kcal | 155 g | 90 g | 568 g |
| Light cut | 3200 kcal | 170 g | 75 g | 461 g |

### Without Cycling (reference from your old routine)
| Phase | Calories | Protein | Fat | Carbs |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Maintain | 3100 kcal | 150 g | 85 g | 434 g |
| Lean bulk | 3300 kcal | 155 g | 90 g | 468 g |
| Light cut | 2800 kcal | 170 g | 70 g | 373 g |

### Why this split
- Protein is set high enough for hypertrophy/retention without overspending calories on unnecessary extra protein.
- Fat stays in a solid performance/health range (~1.0-1.3 g/kg).
- Carbs are prioritized because your week has frequent cycling + gym sessions.

## Day-by-Day Split (with your current cycling week)
Carb periodization is done by moving more calories to harder bike/lower-body demand days and pulling calories down on Saturday.

### Maintain phase (weekly average = 3500 kcal/day)
Protein and fat held constant daily: 150 g protein, 85 g fat.

| Day | Session | Calories | Protein | Fat | Carbs |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Monday | Gym Upper A | 3400 | 150 g | 85 g | 509 g |
| Tuesday | Gym Lower A | 3600 | 150 g | 85 g | 559 g |
| Wednesday | Bike Z2 (75-90 min) | 3550 | 150 g | 85 g | 546 g |
| Thursday | Gym Upper B | 3400 | 150 g | 85 g | 509 g |
| Friday | Bike Tempo/Skill | 3700 | 150 g | 85 g | 584 g |
| Saturday | Optional Light Gym / easier day | 3100 | 150 g | 85 g | 434 g |
| Sunday | Social Ride (2-3 h) | 3750 | 150 g | 85 g | 596 g |

### Lean bulk phase (weekly average = 3700 kcal/day)
Protein and fat held constant daily: 155 g protein, 90 g fat.

| Day | Session | Calories | Protein | Fat | Carbs |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Monday | Gym Upper A | 3600 | 155 g | 90 g | 543 g |
| Tuesday | Gym Lower A | 3800 | 155 g | 90 g | 593 g |
| Wednesday | Bike Z2 (75-90 min) | 3750 | 155 g | 90 g | 580 g |
| Thursday | Gym Upper B | 3600 | 155 g | 90 g | 543 g |
| Friday | Bike Tempo/Skill | 3900 | 155 g | 90 g | 618 g |
| Saturday | Optional Light Gym / easier day | 3300 | 155 g | 90 g | 468 g |
| Sunday | Social Ride (2-3 h) | 3950 | 155 g | 90 g | 630 g |

### Light cut phase (weekly average = 3200 kcal/day)
Protein and fat held constant daily: 170 g protein, 75 g fat.

| Day | Session | Calories | Protein | Fat | Carbs |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Monday | Gym Upper A | 3100 | 170 g | 75 g | 436 g |
| Tuesday | Gym Lower A | 3300 | 170 g | 75 g | 486 g |
| Wednesday | Bike Z2 (75-90 min) | 3250 | 170 g | 75 g | 474 g |
| Thursday | Gym Upper B | 3100 | 170 g | 75 g | 436 g |
| Friday | Bike Tempo/Skill | 3400 | 170 g | 75 g | 511 g |
| Saturday | Optional Light Gym / easier day | 2800 | 170 g | 75 g | 361 g |
| Sunday | Social Ride (2-3 h) | 3450 | 170 g | 75 g | 524 g |

Adjustment rule for Saturday:
- If you skip Saturday gym and total activity is low, reduce Saturday intake by ~100-200 kcal (mostly carbs).
- Keep the weekly average on target by redistributing those carbs to Friday/Sunday if needed.

## Carb Timing (important for your hybrid plan)
- Pre training (gym or bike): 1-2 g/kg carbs in the 2-4 h pre-session if possible.
- During rides >=60 min: 30-60 g carbs/hour.
- Sunday 2-3 h ride: 45-75 g carbs/hour + electrolytes.
- Post hard sessions: include 25-40 g protein + carbs in the next meal.

Practical periodization:
- Keep weekly calories for each phase as above.
- Push more of your daily carbs to Wed/Fri/Sun (bike days), slightly less carbs on easier/lighter days.

## Supplement Split (weekly structure)

## 1) Daily Base (all days)
- Creatine monohydrate: 5 g/day, any time, every day.
- Protein powder: only as needed to hit daily protein target.
- Optional if bloodwork shows need: vitamin D, iron, B12, etc. (deficiency-correcting, not ergogenic by default).

## 2) Pre-Gym Sessions (Mon/Tue/Thu, optional Sat)
- Caffeine: start 2-3 mg/kg 45-60 min pre (140-210 mg for you).
- If needed and tolerated: up to 4-6 mg/kg (280-420 mg), but avoid late-day use if sleep is affected.

## 3) Pre-Key Bike Sessions (especially Fri tempo and harder Sunday blocks)
- Caffeine: 1.5-3 mg/kg pre-ride (105-210 mg) is often enough.
- Nitrate (beetroot juice/concentrate): target 6-8 mmol nitrate (about 370-500 mg nitrate) ~2.5-3 h pre.

## 4) Beta-Alanine Block (for interval-heavy phases)
- 3.2-6.4 g/day, split doses (e.g., 0.8-1.6 g, 2-4x/day) for at least 4 weeks.
- Most useful for hard intervals/efforts lasting ~1-10 minutes (fits Friday tempo/interval work more than long Z2).
- Tingling is common; smaller divided doses reduce it.

## 5) Optional Advanced Add-On (test in training first)
- Sodium bicarbonate: 0.2-0.3 g/kg 60-180 min pre very hard interval/race efforts.
- Can cause GI distress; trial only on non-critical sessions.

## Hydration + Electrolytes
- For longer/hot rides, target roughly 500-900 mg sodium/hour and adjust by sweat rate, weather, and cramping history.

## Monitoring Rules (to keep plan accurate)
- Track daily morning bodyweight; use 7-day average.
- Maintain target: weekly average stable (+/-0.1 kg/week).
- Lean bulk target: +0.15 to +0.30 kg/week.
- Light cut target: -0.20 to -0.40 kg/week.
- If off-target for 2 straight weeks: adjust by 100-150 kcal/day, mostly from carbs.
- If performance crashes on bike while weight still drops too fast, move calories up first (usually +100-200 from carbs on ride days).
